We've seen the term **"DevOps"** too many times. But some of my friends are still confused about this. 

I also spent my time to find out what it means. Here are two links that I think it's useful and understandable for us : 

+ <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/dev-ops-non-engineers/" target="tab">Dev-Ops for Non-Engineers</a>
+ <a href="http://devops.com/2015/04/30/im-happy-devops-engineer-job-title/" target="tab">Why I’m Happy To Have DevOps Engineer In My Job Title
</a>


As a brief, I will shortly describe in this post to help us be more clearly about it. 

***Definition Of A DevOps Engineer***

DevOps Engineers are the people who sit between or within Development and Operations and use automation across the SDLC to reduce the cycle time from development to production.

They will have deep technical skills in tools such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Vagrant and Docker, and use these tools to help their organisations deliver better software, faster and more reliably.   They will also likely understand cloud and how to use infrastructure automation to leverage this to best effect.



***DevOps Isn’t a Job Title***

There’s no standard definition of DevOps. According to The Agile Admin, DevOps is a “methodology of collaboration.” Put another way by the site, it’s “agile systems administration.” That means DevOps is about software developers and ops engineers working together with shared values, principles, methods, practices and tools to build, maintain and improve systems—across the whole services lifecycle.



DevOps is a way of working that emphasizes collaboration, open communication, and the seamless sharing of ideas and code. 

Good DevOps work requires testing, iterating and even breaking things. That needs to happen quickly, without friction and, importantly, without blame.

***About myself***

You know, I mainly use <a href="/puppet/2016/02/03/puppet-automation-series-part-1-introduction/" target="tab">Puppet</a> . Sometimes, I use Ansible but only for small tasks . 

Choose it by yourself.
