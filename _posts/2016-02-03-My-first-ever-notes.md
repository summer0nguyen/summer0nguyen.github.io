My name is *Summer Nguyen*, from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I am working as a System Engineer in Linux, especially CentOS.

I am bad at writting even in my native language, Vietnameses.
I had my plan a long time ago writing my notes about everything I did, sharing my experiences to the community and get feedbacks. But until now, I've start my first ever post.

I will usually write about the tasks, technologies I used at my company in some sections : 

**Basic**

+ Linux basic and useful commands
+ Tutorial how to use some common softwares : git, gitlab, jenkins, DNS management, .. 
+ Debugging , fixxing some problem I got. 



**Advance**

+ Architecture Design for some systems : CDN, Web Farm, CDN
+ Tunnings for kernel, web servers, database servers,...


**Big Data**

+ Hadoop HDFS
+ Central Log Management using : Scribe, Fluentd , Graylog, ... intergrated with Hadoop



Hope this will help me improve my English writing skill and somehow helping people in someway. 

Have a nice day..
